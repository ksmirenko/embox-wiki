This is a complementary article (in addition to the main [contributing
guide](https://github.com/embox/embox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) describing
the accepted Git workflow step-by-step.

TL; DR
------
We use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for the
development, which is basically about committing into branches and merging
through pull requests. **TL; DR**:

  - Git setup: real name and email; Editors/IDE: proper indentation, auto strip
    [trailing whitespaces](http://codeimpossible.com/2012/04/02/Trailing-whitespace-is-evil-Don-t-commit-evil-into-your-repo-/)

  - **Never push to `master`**; start each new feature in a branch:
    - Branch naming: *`short-name-through-hyphens`*; use *`NNNN-bug-name`*
      to refer an issue
    - Within a branch, please keep the history linear, i.e. `rebase` instead
      of `merge` to keep the branch up-to-date

  - [Atomic](http://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/) commits;
    no "oops" commits, [squash](#squash-commits-into-a-single-one) if needed;
    **Git commit message agreements**

  - Respect those who will review your changes: prepare your branch **before**
    opening a PR, cleanup commits and rebase to catch-up recent changes
    from `upstream/master`

  - Do not rebase already published changes and force-push **until review is
    over**: push `fixup!` commits, then rebase one last time once getting LGTM
    from maintainers

Before you start
----------------
Make sure to perform the necessary
[setup steps](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/):

```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```

Please use **your real name** (no nicknames, sorry).

There is also a recommended setup, please see [below](#recommended-setup).

Clone the repository
----------------------
If you're new to GitHub's Fork & Pull model, you'll probably find
this [help article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) useful.

In a nutshell to clone your fork and setup the upstream:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/embox embox
cd embox

git remote add upstream https://github.com/embox/embox.git

git remote -v
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/embox.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/embox.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/embox/embox.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/embox/embox.git (push)
```

Contributors with push access clone the original repository directly, i.e.
the upstream is `origin`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/embox/embox embox
cd embox

# (optionally) Setup upstream as an alias of origin
git remote add upstream https://github.com/embox/embox.git
```

Note: Depending on whether you have
[SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) set up,
you may wish to prefer using `git@github.com:embox/embox.git` as the clone URL.

Feature process
---------------
Do these things for each feature you work on. To switch features, just use `git
checkout my-branch`.

### Start a new feature branch

Create a new branch from `master`. The code in `master` always
compiles and passes all tests (well, it tends to).

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout upstream/master -b my-branch

  - Give a new branch some descriptive name, separate words with hyphens

  - If it's a feature branch, it may be worth spending some time to open an
    issue and describe your intentions. Someone may already have had some
    thoughts on the topic and could probably give you some advice

  - It is a good practice to begin a branch name with a number of the issue
    being addressed, like *`NNNN-bug-name`*, for example,
    *`721-contributing-guide`*. This will update the issue status accordingly

### Do the work

*Hack, hack, hack...*

### Synchronize with the upstream

Before publishing your work please pick up all recent upstream changes. May be
someone has added a fix for a bug that you were forced to work around?

The main point here is to `rebase`, i.e. "replay" your changes on top of the
updated `upstream/master`.

  - When doing `pull`, always do it with `--rebase` to avoid unnecessary merge
    commits:

        git checkout my-branch
        git pull --rebase upstream

    - Setup `git config --bool pull.rebase true` to make `pull` imply
      `--rebase` by default
    - You might prefer using tools like
      [git-up](http://aanandprasad.com/git-up/)

  - To catch up any new changes from `master` use `rebase` instead of `merge`:

        git checkout my-branch
        git fetch upstream
        git rebase upstream/master

### Push the changes

Please spend extra 5-15 minutes to organize your commits. The person who will
review your changes would really appreciate that.

  - Use `git commit --amend` to edit the last commit, **don't produce
    unnecessary "oops" commits**

  - Befriend `git rebase --interactive`

  - Quite often, especially when developing something from scratch,
    you'll only need a single commit: add a new driver, fix a crash, etc.

Please also refer to the [checklists](#checklists) and the
[cheatsheet](#cheatsheet) below.

Then just do it:

    git push origin my-branch

To push a new branch created locally, you will probably need to set up
tracking information:

    git push --set-upstream origin my-branch

If you edit the history (to integrate feedback, or to add a change you forgot
to commit to an existing commit), you will need to use `--force` to push the
branch. When force-pushing, **always specify the branch explicitly**:

    git push --force origin my-branch

  - Also setup `git config push.default simple` for extra safety

> Force-pushing is safe provided two things are true:
>   - The branch has not yet been merged to the upstream repo
>   - You are only force-pushing to your fork, not to the upstream repo
>
> Generally, no other users will have work based on your pull request, so
> force-pushing history won't cause problems.

### Open a pull request

Before opening a new pull request for you branch, especially for long running
branches, please take a look at you changes once again. Basically, it's worth
performing the same checks as for [pushing](#pushing-the-changes) described
above.

It is also worth [synchronizing](#synchronize-with-the-upstream) your local
repository with the upstream to catch up all recent updates from
`upstream/master` and checking once again that nothing is broken. This way, it
is guaranteed that your branch will merge cleanly, i.e. the pull request can be
merged by the "Merge" button from the GitHub web interface.

### Integrate feedback

Very likely, you will be advised on how to make your proposed changes better.
Quite often these are just remarks about coding style, typos, bad naming, etc.
There are also real bugs like a missing error check or resource leaks.

Please, seek out the commits that introduced bad lines and **add follow-up 
changes as separate `fixup!` commits**. This is trivial for a single commit
PRs; `git blame` to the rescue otherwise.

This way, after review is over you will be able to perform auto-squash rebase
and pretend that you made everything correctly right from the beginning.

Few things to note here and to summarize:

  - Unless you really screwed up and maintainers ask you explicitly, do not
    rebase and force-push **during the review process**. It is a rather
    confusing practice

  - Instead, put some efforts to prepare the branch for review **before** 
    opening a PR, i.e. squash "oops" commits, check against the checklists,
    etc.

  - Add follow-up changes as distinct `fixup!` commits referring the proper
    commits from your branch and push them as usual, without rebasing

  - Finally, **once review is over** rebase for the last time to squash fixup
    commits you made

  - For maintainers: please don't push "Merge" button until Travis CI finishes
    to build the PR, even if you just happened to reword a typo in some
    commits message and sure that this won't break a build.

    Otherwise, Travis won't cancel the build anyway but will fail to fetch
    necessary refs for the closed PR, thereby spamming about the broken build.

    Just don't do that and wait until getting "green" light.
